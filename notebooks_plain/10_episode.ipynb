    "\n",
    "If the program behaves in the same why have we changed it in this way? The reason is that running a Python script in bash is very similar to importing that file in Python. The biggest difference is that we donâ€™t expect anything to happen when we import a file, whereas when running a script, we expect to see some output printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a Python script to work as expected when imported or when run as a script, we typically put the part of the script that produces output in the following if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    main()  # Or whatever function produces output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you `import` a Python file, `__name__` is a special variable which holds the name of that file (e.g., when importing `readings.py`, `__name__` is `'readings'`). However, when running a script in bash, `__name__` is always set to `'__main__'` in that script so that you can determine if the file is being imported or run as a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting the practice of encapsulating the script part of our code in a `main` function we are making sure that we can safely `import` our code in other programs to safely reuse the fantastic functions we write."

    "## Pen: The Right Way to Do It\n",
    "If our programs can take complex parameters or multiple filenames, we shouldnâ€™t handle `sys.argv` directly. Instead, we should use Pythonâ€™s `argparse` library, which handles common cases in a systematic way, and also makes it easy for us to provide sensible error messages for our users. We will not cover this module in this lesson but you can go to Tshepang Lekhonkhobeâ€™s [Argparse tutorial](http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/argparse.html) that is part of Pythonâ€™s Official Documentation."
